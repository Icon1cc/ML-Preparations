## 🛠️ How to Complete This Repository

### For Contributors

#### **Writing Style Guidelines**

Based on existing files, maintain:

1. **Plain English First**
   - Start with intuition before math
   - Use analogies and real-world examples
   - "Think of X like Y" explanations

2. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Simple → Complex
   - What → Why → How
   - Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced

3. **Interview Focus**
   - "Common Interview Questions" sections
   - "When to Use" vs "When NOT to Use"
   - Tradeoff discussions
   - Sample answers to questions

4. **Practical Examples**
   - Python code snippets
   - Real-world scenarios (logistics, supply chain)
   - Production considerations

5. **Visual Aids**
   - Mermaid diagrams for architectures
   - Comparison tables
   - Decision trees
   - ASCII art for simple concepts

6. **Structure**
   ```markdown
