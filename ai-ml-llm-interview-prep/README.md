## 💡 How to Use This Repository Effectively

### For Case Studies
1. **Read the problem statement first** without looking at the solution
2. **Spend 15-20 minutes** sketching your own approach
3. **Compare with the provided solution** - note what you missed
4. **Practice explaining the solution out loud** as if in an interview
5. **Review the "Possible Follow-ups"** section and prepare answers

### For Technical Topics
1. **Read the intuition first** before diving into math
2. **Work through code examples** - don't just read them
3. **Focus on "When to use" vs "When not to use"** sections
4. **Review interview questions** at the end of each section
5. **Create your own comparison tables** for similar concepts

### For System Design
1. **Understand the problem deeply** before proposing solutions
2. **Always start with requirements** (functional + non-functional)
3. **Draw diagrams** (use the Mermaid examples as templates)
4. **Discuss tradeoffs explicitly** - there's no perfect solution
5. **Practice end-to-end walkthroughs** with a friend or mentor

## 🎤 Interview Tips for AI/Data Science Roles

### General Approach
- ✅ **Think out loud** - interviewers want to see your thought process
- ✅ **Ask clarifying questions** - especially about business context, data availability, constraints
- ✅ **Start simple, then iterate** - don't jump to complex solutions immediately
- ✅ **Discuss tradeoffs** - accuracy vs latency, cost vs performance, complexity vs maintainability
- ✅ **Connect to business value** - how does your technical solution drive impact?

### For Technical Screening
- Focus on fundamentals: evaluation metrics, overfitting, cross-validation
- Be ready to write code: scikit-learn pipelines, simple PyTorch models
- Know your complexity: time/space complexity of algorithms
- Explain your choices: why this algorithm? why this metric?

### For System Design
- Always clarify requirements first (scale, latency, budget, team size)
- Start with high-level architecture, then drill down
- Discuss data pipelines, not just models
- Cover monitoring, testing, and failure modes
- Be ready to estimate: QPS, storage, compute costs

### For Case Studies
- Structure your answer: problem → data → approach → evaluation → production → monitoring
- Show business understanding: what's the ROI? what are the risks?
- Discuss stakeholder communication: how would you explain this to non-technical leaders?
- Prepare for follow-ups: "what if data is missing?" "how would you scale this?" "what could go wrong?"

### For Behavioral Rounds
- Prepare 3-4 strong project stories (use STAR format)
- Focus on impact: what changed because of your work?
- Discuss failures and learnings openly
- Show collaboration skills and stakeholder management
