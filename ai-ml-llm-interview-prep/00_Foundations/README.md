### Frequently Asked Questions

**"What metric would you use for [specific problem]?"**
- See [Evaluation Metrics Taxonomy](./evaluation_metrics_taxonomy.md)

**"How would you handle class imbalance?"**
- Covered in [Evaluation Metrics](./evaluation_metrics_taxonomy.md) and [Data Preprocessing](./data_preprocessing_patterns.md)

**"Explain the bias-variance tradeoff"**
- See [Bias-Variance Tradeoff](./bias_variance_tradeoff.md)

**"How do you prevent overfitting?"**
- See [Overfitting vs Underfitting](./overfitting_vs_underfitting.md)

**"What's the difference between L1 and L2 regularization?"**
- Covered in [Optimization Basics](./optimization_basics.md)

## 🚀 Quick Start

**If you're short on time:**

1. Start with [Evaluation Metrics Taxonomy](./evaluation_metrics_taxonomy.md) - 90 minutes
2. Read [Bias-Variance Tradeoff](./bias_variance_tradeoff.md) - 30 minutes
3. Review [Data Leakage](./data_leakage.md) - 20 minutes
4. Skim [Feature Engineering Fundamentals](./feature_engineering_fundamentals.md) - 30 minutes

This gives you the highest ROI for interview preparation.

## 📊 Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming
- High school algebra and calculus (derivatives)
- Basic probability (what is a probability distribution?)

## 🔗 Connections to Other Sections

- **01 Machine Learning**: These foundations are applied throughout classical ML algorithms
- **02 Deep Learning**: Linear algebra and optimization are critical for understanding neural networks
- **06 MLOps**: Data preprocessing and evaluation metrics are essential for production systems
- **08 Case Studies**: Every case study requires selecting appropriate metrics and preprocessing strategies

## 💡 Study Tips

1. **Don't memorize formulas** - Understand the intuition and when to apply each concept
2. **Connect to real problems** - For each concept, think of a business problem where it matters
3. **Practice explaining** - Can you explain bias-variance to a non-technical stakeholder?
4. **Use the examples** - Work through the code snippets; don't just read them
