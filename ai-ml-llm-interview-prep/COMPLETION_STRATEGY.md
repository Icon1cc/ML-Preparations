## Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Best for Most People)

### **Step 1: Study What Exists (Week 1)**
- Read all 15 complete files (~12-15 hours)
- Work through code examples
- Practice explaining concepts

### **Step 2: Priority Content Creation (Weeks 2-3)**
- Create Tier 1 files (10 highest priority)
- ~30-40 hours of focused writing
- Covers LLMs, RAG, prompt engineering

### **Step 3: Supplement with External Resources (Weeks 2-4)**
- Use section READMEs as roadmap
- Fill gaps with courses and documentation
- Focus on hands-on practice

### **Step 4: Case Study Practice (Week 4)**
- Study the complete case study
- Create 2-3 your own case studies
- Mock interviews using frameworks

**Total time:** 80-100 hours over 4 weeks
**Outcome:** Interview-ready with strong foundation

## What I Recommend Based on Your Timeline

### **If Interview is in 1 Week:**
Use Option 2 - study existing content + focused external resources for gaps

### **If Interview is in 2-4 Weeks:**
Use Option 3 - hybrid approach

### **If Building Long-Term:**
Use Option 1 - systematically create all priority content
